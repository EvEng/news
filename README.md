# Syllabus and News for CS594/690: Evidence Engineering

* **Course:** [COSCS-594/690]
* ** MK623  TR  9:40AM-10:55AM (Min Kao 623) **
* **Instructor:** Audris Mockus, [audris@utk.edu](mailto:audris@utk.edu) office hours MK613 - on request


The primary purpose of the course is to learn-by-doing advanced operational data techniques including:
1. Text analysis, e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, NMF, LDA, LSTM
2. Image analysis, e.g., RCNN, Mask-RCNN, CAM, ...
3. Network analysis, network databases (neo4j), 
4. Advanced data analysis, Graphical models

Each of the techniques will be learned through work on a real project.
